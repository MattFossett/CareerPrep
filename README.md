# Matt Fossett Career Prep Repo

This repository is a central view into how I am preparing for interviews and further studying Computer Science topics. I am using the book **"Cracking the Coding Interview"** by Gayle Laakmann to work on complex coding and complexity problems. I am also choosing to implement many algorithms and data structures to make sure I have a thorough grasp on these topics. I intend on thoroughly commenting these small projects with notes on complexity and faults that I encountered along the way. While I appreciate C++ with its speed and low level programming, I have chosen to implement these small projects with Java. This is because I can write Java code much faster than C++ and I appreciate the simpler debug time. I feel that this allows me to learn the concepts of each algorithm and data structure, rather than focusing too much attention on C++ skills.
